Broadcom BCM7120 Level 2 interrupt controller

- typically has one 32-bit enable word and one 32-bit status word, but on
  some hardware may have more than one enable/status pair

- no atomic set/clear operations

- not all bits within the interrupt controller actually map to an interrupt
Required properties:

- compatible: should be "brcm,bcm7120-l2-intc"
- reg: specifies the base physical address and size of the registers;
  multiple pairs may be specified, with the first pair handling IRQ offsets
  0..31 and the second pair handling 32..63
- interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an interrupt
  source, should be 1.
- interrupt-parent: specifies the phandle to the parent interrupt controller
  this one is cascaded from
- interrupts: specifies the interrupt line(s) in the interrupt-parent domain
  to be used for cascading
- brcm,int-map-mask: 32-bits bit mask describing how the interrupts at this level
  map to their respective parents. Should match exactly the number of interrupts
  specified in the 'interrupts' property, multiplied by the number of
  enable/status register pairs implemented by this controller.  For
  multiple parent IRQs with multiple enable/status words, this looks like:
  <irq0_w0 irq0_w1 irq1_w0 irq1_w1 ...>

Optional properties:

- brcm,irq-can-wake: if present, this means the L2 controller can be used as a
  wakeup source for system suspend/resume.

- brcm,int-fwd-mask: if present, a bit mask to configure the interrupts which
  have a mux gate, typically UARTs. Setting these bits will make their
  respective interrupt outputs bypass this 2nd level interrupt controller
  completely; it is completely transparent for the interrupt controller
  parent. This should have one 32-bit word per enable/status pair.

Example:

irq0_intc: interrupt-controller@f0406800 {
	compatible = "brcm,bcm7120-l2-intc";
	interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	#interrupt-cells = <1>;
	reg = <0xf0406800 0x8>;
	interrupt-controller;
	interrupts = <0x0 0x42 0x0>, <0x0 0x40 0x0>;
	interrupt-names = "upg_main", "upg_bsc";
	brcm,int-map-mask = <0xeb8>, <0x140>;
	brcm,int-fwd-mask = <0x7>;
};
