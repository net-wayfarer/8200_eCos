Broadcom BCM6328 High-Speed SPI controller

Required properties:

- compatible: Should be "brcm,bcm6328-hsspi"
- reg: Should contain the register base address and length
- interrupts: Should contain the interrupt number
- clocks: The clock feeding this SPI controller
- clock-names: Should be "hsspi"
- #address-cells: Must be 1 for child chip-select nodes
- #size-cells: Must be 0 for child chip-select nodes

Optional sub-nodes:

Example:

spi@b0001000 {
       compatible = "brcm,bcm6328-hsspi";
       reg = <0xb0001000 0x600>;
       interrupts = <29>;
       clocks = <&hsspi_clock>;
       clock-names = "hsspi";
       #address-cells = <1>;
       #size-cells = <0>;

       flash@0 {
               compatible = "m25p80";
               spi-max-frequency = <125000000>;
               reg = <0>;

               ...
       };
};
